# Codex Native API TODO

This document tracks the implementation backlog for the `track/codex-native-api`
workstream.

It is the execution-oriented companion to:

- `docs/architecture/codexbridge-core-architecture.md`
- `docs/architecture/codex-native-api.md`
- `docs/todo/roadmap.md`

## Scope

Codex Native API should expose the already logged-in local Codex app-server as a
localhost-callable API surface.

Its first product purpose is **not** to replace the main CodexBridge chat flow.
Its main purpose is to provide an isolated execution surface for:

- classification
- intent detection
- normalization
- short verification
- lightweight side reasoning
- external local clients that need a standard API surface

without polluting the active CodexBridge conversation thread.

It should own:

- localhost API exposure over the logged-in Codex app-server
- Responses-first request/response routing
- `response_id` / continuation mapping needed to emulate stateless API calls
- optional Chat Completions compatibility later
- package- or module-local routing policy for isolated subtasks
- local auth / binding / safety rules for the native API surface

It should **not** own:

- WeChat or Telegram transport behavior
- bridge session binding UX
- SendGate, preview/final chunking, or `ret:-2`
- external provider adaptation already covered by `@codexbridge/codex-gateway`
- user-facing slash-command policy unless a command is explicitly added later
- commercial billing, top-up, or payment workflows

## Track Branch

Primary long-lived branch for this workstream:

```text
track/codex-native-api
```

Expected file ownership for this branch:

- `docs/todo/codex-native-api.md`
- `docs/architecture/codex-native-api.md`
- `docs/architecture/codexbridge-core-architecture.md`
- future native-api runtime files once implementation starts

Avoid frequent edits here unless the change is truly cross-cutting:

- `docs/todo/roadmap.md`
- `README.md`
- `package.json`

## Immutable Workstream Goal

Expose the logged-in local Codex capability as a localhost-callable API so
CodexBridge can run isolated side tasks without polluting the main Codex thread,
while keeping the primary WeChat chat flow unchanged.

In short:

- main conversation flow stays on the current Codex app-server integration
- isolated side tasks prefer Codex Native API
- external provider APIs remain fallback / optional, not the primary path

Canonical one-sentence goal:

> Codex Native API 的目标是把已登录本地 Codex app-server 的订阅能力封装成 localhost 可调用的标准 API，并优先承接 CodexBridge 的隔离型副任务，同时保持主聊天链路不变。

Evolution direction:

- first implementation: internal CodexBridge runtime/module
- next: reusable workspace package
- later if justified: standalone npm package that others can install without
  depending on full CodexBridge bridge UX

## Current Active Focus

- [x] Lock the routing model:
  - main chat flow stays unchanged
  - isolated side tasks prefer native API
  - external providers are fallback
- [x] Lock the fallback hierarchy:
  - preferred: native API
  - local degradation: direct native isolated execution
  - final fallback: external provider path
- [x] Lock ownership and non-ownership at the document level
- [x] Lock the recommended first implementation shape:
  - start as an internal CodexBridge runtime/module, not a new standalone npm
    package
- [x] Lock the API-facade principle:
  - native API should wrap the existing isolated native execution capability,
    not replace it with a separate engine
- [x] Lock the packaging direction:
  - first internal runtime/module
  - then reusable workspace package
  - later standalone npm package if the boundary proves stable
- [x] Phase 1 planning:
  - define the first localhost Responses surface
  - define continuation registry expectations
  - define internal helper call sites that should later route into native API
- [ ] Start implementation in the ordered sequence below instead of jumping
  between unrelated phases

## Reference Projects

These projects are references only. They should inform design choices, not be
vendored blindly.

### `Wei-Shaw/sub2api`

Role:

- subscription-to-API product reference

Use for:

- how a subscription-backed service can be surfaced as a standard API
- operational split between upstream account state and downstream API clients
- sticky account/session thinking
- self-hosted service shape and management expectations

Do **not** copy directly:

- payment/top-up/billing product scope
- commercial multi-tenant account marketplace concerns
- large control-plane scope that is not needed for the first Codex-native path

Upstream:

- <https://github.com/Wei-Shaw/sub2api>

### `router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI`

Role:

- compatibility/router reference

Use for:

- protocol breadth (`Responses`, `Chat Completions`, Gemini, Claude, Codex)
- config-first compatibility switches
- payload filter/override/default rules
- local service shape, localhost-first deployment, and management separation
- session affinity and retry/fallback design ideas

Do **not** copy directly:

- multi-provider gateway sprawl into the native-only first phase
- all provider-specific management/UI scope
- remote-exposed management assumptions for an initial localhost-only server

Upstream:

- <https://github.com/router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI>
- <https://help.router-for.me/>

## Design Rules

1. Main CodexBridge chat turns must keep using the current Codex app-server path.
2. Codex Native API is for isolated, side-effect-contained calls first.
3. Responses-first is the primary API surface.
4. Chat Completions compatibility is a later compatibility layer, not Phase 1.
5. Native API should bind to `127.0.0.1` by default.
6. Native API should reuse existing Codex login/subscription state; it should
   not require a normal OpenAI API key.
7. Native API should not pretend to mint a real cloud OpenAI key; it is a local
   facade over a logged-in Codex runtime.
8. Native API and main chat flow share the same underlying Codex subscription
   pool, so routing must stay intentional.

## Ordered Executable Sequence

Follow this order. Do not jump ahead unless the earlier item is blocked and the
block is clearly documented.

### 1. Native subscription runtime extraction

Reference focus:

- Sub2API: account/session separation, sticky account identity
- CLIProxyAPI: host-side auth state separated from downstream API usage

Build:

- one internal native runtime service over the logged-in Codex app-server
- active-account lookup and account-switch integration
- readiness checks
- one isolated execution entrypoint for side-task runs

Completion target:

- all later native API work calls the same native runtime substrate instead of
  inventing a second execution path

### 2. Localhost Responses API shell

Reference focus:

- CLIProxyAPI localhost deployment shape and downstream local auth model

Build:

- localhost-only server
- `GET /v1/models`
- `POST /v1/responses`
- optional `POST /v1/responses/compact`
- minimal local auth/shared-secret policy if needed

Completion target:

- logged-in Codex can be called through a stable local Responses-first API

### 3. Continuation registry and sticky execution mapping

Reference focus:

- Sub2API sticky session/account affinity
- CLIProxyAPI session continuity and routing affinity

Build:

- `response_id -> native execution identity`
- `previous_response_id -> continuation lookup`
- account/runtime affinity for continuation chains
- continuation expiry and bookkeeping

Completion target:

- API callers get stateless-looking continuation while the native runtime keeps
  the actual chain alive

### 4. Internal side-task routing and direct local fallback

Reference focus:

- CLIProxyAPI routing/fallback policy
- current CodexBridge helper-thread execution model

Build:

- opt-in routing for isolated helper task classes
- direct native fallback when the localhost API facade is unavailable
- external-provider fallback only after native routes fail or are explicitly
  overridden

Completion target:

- internal slash-command judgments and similar helper tasks default to native
  execution instead of external-provider APIs

### 5. Compatibility and hardening

Reference focus:

- CLIProxyAPI compatibility ergonomics
- Sub2API operational stability mindset

Build:

- streaming hardening
- trace/debug/health visibility
- restart/recovery behavior
- optional `Chat Completions` compatibility
- controlled external fallback policy

Completion target:

- Codex Native API becomes a reusable and debuggable long-running local service
  rather than a one-off adapter

## Routing Priority

Target routing priority:

1. Main conversation / main thread tasks
   - direct current Codex app-server path
2. Isolated side tasks
   - Codex Native API
3. Local direct fallback
   - direct native isolated execution when the API layer is unavailable but
     native Codex is still healthy
4. External provider fallback
   - `@codexbridge/codex-gateway` / compatible providers only when native API is
     unavailable, native Codex is unhealthy, or an explicit override requires
     it

## Initial Internal Helper Call Sites

These are the first internal helper lanes that should later be able to route
into Codex Native API once the runtime and API shell exist:

- assistant record natural-language handling:
  - `/as`
  - `/log`
  - `/todo`
  - `/remind`
  - `/note`
- `/auto` natural-language planning and edit flows
- `/threads` and `/search` command-skill parsing
- `/instructions` normalization
- `/review` helper classification
- `/agent` draft/planning-side helper calls

These are side-task candidates, not evidence that the main chat lane should be
re-routed.

## Continuation Registry Expectations

The first continuation registry should be able to persist or reconstruct at
least:

- `response_id`
- `previous_response_id`
- `native_thread_id`
- optional `native_turn_id`
- `active_account_id`
- `model`
- `route_kind`
- `started_at`
- `last_used_at`
- `expiry_at`

## Recommended Implementation Boundary

The first implementation should live inside CodexBridge as a native runtime
module close to the existing Codex app-server integration, not as a separate
package like `codex-gateway`.

Reason:

- it depends on logged-in native Codex runtime state
- it depends on thread/turn continuation mapping
- it should not pretend to be a generic external-provider adapter

Recommended early ownership candidates:

- future native-api runtime/module files
- `src/providers/codex/**` adjacent integration glue
- native-api-specific docs and tests

Do **not** start by extracting a generic package boundary unless a second real
consumer appears.

## Packaging Evolution Plan

### Stage A: Internal runtime/module

Current chosen direction.

- implement next to existing native Codex runtime wiring
- prove runtime/API/continuation behavior first
- avoid freezing the wrong package API too early

### Stage B: Internal workspace package

Target once runtime and API surface stabilize:

```text
packages/codex-native-api
```

Potential later split if justified:

```text
packages/codex-native-runtime
packages/codex-native-api
```

### Stage C: Standalone npm package

Only after:

- API contract is stable
- continuation behavior is well-tested
- CodexBridge is no longer the only real consumer
- the package can stand on its own without bridge-specific UX assumptions

## Phase Plan

### Phase 0: Architecture lock

- [x] Confirm the immutable routing model:
  - main chat flow stays unchanged
  - side tasks prefer native API
  - external providers are fallback
- [x] Define native API ownership and non-ownership clearly in docs
- [x] Decide that the first implementation lives inside CodexBridge runtime
  or behind a dedicated internal package/module boundary
  - chosen direction: internal CodexBridge runtime/module first, not a new
    package

### Phase 1: Minimal localhost Responses API

- [ ] Expose `GET /v1/models`
- [ ] Expose `POST /v1/responses`
- [ ] Support streaming Responses output
- [ ] Map Codex-native continuation/thread semantics to `response_id` /
  `previous_response_id`
- [ ] Bind localhost only by default
- [ ] Add minimal local auth or shared-secret policy if needed
- [ ] Reuse the same native isolated execution primitive already proven by
  current helper-thread / command-skill flows
- [ ] Extract or wrap a stable native runtime service instead of directly
  calling scattered provider primitives

### Phase 2: Internal isolated-task routing

- [ ] Define task classes suitable for native API routing:
  - intent classification
  - normalization
  - small verification
  - side reasoning
- [ ] Define how internal callers opt into native API without changing the main
  user-visible thread flow
- [ ] Ensure native API calls do not pollute the active bridge session history
- [ ] Define the in-process direct-native fallback path when the localhost API
  surface is unavailable
- [ ] Prove that helper-task routing can use native API without polluting the
  active bridge session history

### Phase 3: Chat compatibility

- [ ] Expose `POST /v1/chat/completions`
- [ ] Define how tool calling should map, if supported
- [ ] Decide which features intentionally stay Responses-only

### Phase 4: Hardening

- [ ] Add regression coverage for:
  - continuation mapping
  - streaming event ordering
  - local auth / localhost-only assumptions
  - restart/reconnect behavior when app-server is restarted
- [ ] Add observability for:
  - request routing target
  - response mapping
  - continuation/session linkage

### Phase 5: Package extraction readiness

- [ ] Confirm that the internal runtime/module boundary no longer depends on
  bridge-specific UX behavior
- [ ] Decide whether a single `packages/codex-native-api` package is enough or
  whether runtime/server should split
- [ ] Define the minimal public API surface for package consumers
- [ ] Ensure localhost server startup can work without requiring WeChat/Telegram
  bridge runtime
- [ ] Add package-level tests and exports once extraction begins

## Suggested Phase 1 Deliverable

Phase 1 should be considered complete when all of the following are true:

- localhost `GET /v1/models` works against logged-in Codex runtime state
- localhost `POST /v1/responses` can create isolated runs
- streaming works for those isolated runs
- `previous_response_id` can resume through the continuation registry
- the API path reuses the same proven local isolated execution primitive rather
  than inventing a second execution engine
- the main WeChat chat flow remains on the current direct app-server path
- no external provider API key is required for this path

## Completion Criteria

- [ ] Codex Native API can expose logged-in Codex as a localhost Responses API
- [ ] Main WeChat chat flow remains unchanged
- [ ] Internal isolated tasks can prefer native API without polluting the main
  thread
- [ ] Direct local native fallback exists beneath the API layer before any
  external-provider fallback is used
- [ ] External provider fallback remains optional and clearly secondary
- [ ] The docs clearly distinguish native API from `codex-gateway`
- [ ] The design stays compatible with later extraction into a reusable
  workspace package and eventual standalone npm package if the boundary proves
  stable
