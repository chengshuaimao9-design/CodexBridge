# CodexBridge Roadmap TODO

This document is the top-level roadmap for CodexBridge.

It should stay short and stable. Detailed implementation checklists belong in
feature-specific TODO files instead of being expanded here.

## Immutable Target

CodexBridge 的目标是通过微信稳定暴露 Codex 原生能力，并在桥接层扩展微信命令和个人助理工作流；`@codexbridge/codex-gateway` 的目标是让 Codex 稳定接入多模型来源。

This target is stable. The route, package layout, and branch strategy may
change, but every new task should be judged against whether it advances this
target.

## Working Branch Model

The repository should be developed through long-lived workstream branches, not
one short-lived branch per tiny feature:

```text
main
  stable integration line

track/codex-gateway
  Codex Gateway protocol workstream

track/mission-control
  Mission Control orchestration workstream

track/codex-native-api
  Codex-native localhost API workstream
```

Rules:

- `main` should stay mergeable and reasonably stable
- `track/codex-gateway` should primarily own Codex Gateway protocol/package work
- `track/mission-control` should primarily own Mission Control runtime/package work
- `track/codex-native-api` should primarily own Codex-native API exposure, localhost facade design, and isolated side-task routing policy
- `track/codex-native-api` should also preserve a clean extraction path toward a reusable package if the native-api boundary stabilizes
- low-level checklist churn should stay out of this file
- avoid frequent concurrent edits to shared files such as:
  - `docs/todo/roadmap.md`
  - `README.md`
  - `package.json`

## Detailed Backlogs

Use these files for detailed implementation work:

- [Codex Gateway TODO](./codex-gateway.md)
- [Mission Control TODO](./mission-control.md)
- [Codex Native API TODO](./codex-native-api.md)

Architecture references:

- [Core architecture](../architecture/codexbridge-core-architecture.md)
- [Mission Control architecture](../architecture/mission-control.md)
- [Codex Native API architecture](../architecture/codex-native-api.md)

Reference sources currently tracked:

- `reference/codex-gateway` for LiteLLM, codex-proxy, open-responses, and llm-rosetta
- `reference/symphony` as the orchestration reference mirror when available
- external upstream references:
  - `Wei-Shaw/sub2api`
  - `router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI`

## Current Snapshot

Already landed and no longer part of the active detailed backlog:

- `/review` for uncommitted changes and base-branch review
- `/agent` experimental Codex-first hybrid background jobs with draft-confirm, full-access Codex execution, verifier checks, and retry
- `/plan` session-level native planning mode toggle
- `/skills`, `/apps`, `/plugins`, and `/mcp` visibility and control surfaces
- `/automation` draft-confirm flow and WeChat delivery-oriented scheduling
- Assistant records via `/as`, `/log`, `/todo`, `/remind`, and `/note`
- WeChat thread browsing with `/threads`, `/open`, `/search`, `/peek`, `/rename`
- Native-ish reconnect, retry, approval, and attachment delivery hardening
- `@codexbridge/codex-gateway` extracted as an internal package with package tests, boundary checks, and gated live-provider smoke flow
- `@codexbridge/mission-control` bootstrapped as an internal package skeleton

Important clarification:

- `/open <thread>` remains the practical “resume this old session” path, so a separate `/resume` command is not a current priority
- `/status` already exposes working-directory and session context well enough for now, so a separate `/cwd` command is not a current priority

## Cross-Cutting Priorities

These are the priorities that still belong in the shared roadmap because they
affect the product as a whole, not just one package.

### P0: WeChat runtime reliability

- [ ] Keep improving native approval, interrupted-turn, reconnect, and retry handling around long-running tasks
- [ ] Stabilize WeChat preview/final delivery around send-budget limits, `ret:-2`, and long-reply recovery
- [ ] Ensure plugin/auth/unavailable-capability failures always surface as clear chat-visible guidance instead of silent stalls
- [ ] Keep parser/helper/internal bridge threads hidden from normal thread browsing and automatically cleaned up
- [ ] Keep `/open`, `/threads`, and `/status` optimized for fast real-world session recovery instead of adding redundant resume-style commands

### P1: Native output and delivery quality

- [ ] Continue expanding provider-native artifact delivery instead of adding more bridge-only glue
- [ ] Support more Codex-native output kinds with consistent attachment metadata and delivery policy
- [ ] Keep refining file delivery defaults so generated artifacts feel like first-class Codex outputs
- [ ] Improve model / usage / thread introspection where Codex already exposes reliable primitives
- [ ] Read project-local `.codex` environment metadata so shared local environment setup can inform bridge runs

### P2: Assistant and desktop follow-through

- [ ] Keep improving assistant-record, reminder, and automation delivery quality on WeChat
- [ ] Add optional sync targets for assistant records, such as Notion, Google Drive, or Calendar, while keeping local records as source of truth
- [ ] Design a browser-preview workflow that approximates Codex app browser comments and browser-use results in chat
- [ ] Design a companion-based computer-use workflow for desktop GUI tasks with explicit approvals and app allowlists
- [ ] Decide whether these desktop-native abilities belong in CodexBridge itself or in a separate local companion service

### P2: Codex Gateway summary

- [x] Prove end-to-end profile switching across OpenAI-native, DeepSeek, MiniMax, Qwen, and OpenRouter without changing WeChat UX
- [ ] Revisit standalone launcher publication only if product direction changes; it is intentionally internal-only for now
- [ ] Keep deferred OpenRouter live validation clearly separated from completed package-local protocol work

Detailed checklist:

- [Codex Gateway TODO](./codex-gateway.md)

### P2: Codex Native API summary

- [ ] Expose the logged-in local Codex runtime as a localhost Responses-first API without changing the main WeChat chat flow
- [ ] Route isolated side tasks to Codex Native API while keeping full conversation tasks on the current Codex app-server path
- [ ] Keep external provider APIs as fallback/optional paths rather than the primary route for isolated subtasks
- [ ] Keep the first implementation internal, but preserve a clean path toward later extraction as a reusable package and eventual standalone npm package if justified

Detailed checklist:

- [Codex Native API TODO](./codex-native-api.md)

### P2: Mission Control summary

- [x] Preserve Symphony's real core ideas: workflow-owned policy, single orchestrator authority, stable workspace identity, continuation retries after normal exit, and handoff/wait-user states
- [x] Add workflow loading, workpad persistence, workspace isolation, and bounded run/verify/repair loop
- [x] Keep WeChat as the control and notification entrypoint while Mission Control owns orchestration

Detailed checklist:

- [Mission Control TODO](./mission-control.md)

## Guardrails

- [ ] Do not prioritize new bridge-only slash commands ahead of high-value native Codex parity work unless the native layer is unavailable
- [ ] Do not add bridge-only aliases when existing commands already cover the user need well enough, such as `/open` for resume-style continuation or `/status` for cwd/session inspection
- [ ] Do not let this file become a second detailed implementation log for Codex Gateway or Mission Control

## Later Direction: Telegram Runtime

The bridge-side Telegram plugin contract exists, but the real transport stack is
still a later-phase item.

- [ ] Add a real Telegram inbound poller or webhook runtime
- [ ] Add real Telegram outbound transport for text, typing, media, and files
- [ ] Wire Telegram runtime into the same persisted bridge-session flow used by WeChat
- [ ] Verify the same bridge session can be continued across WeChat and Telegram end-to-end
